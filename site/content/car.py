The crashes we see most often are rear-end collisions in stop-and-go traffic on Main Street and Dorchester Road, left-turn and failure-to-yield crashes at the big intersections, interstate collisions near the 17-A and College Park interchanges, and distracted or impaired drivers on the two-lane roads out toward Ridgeville and Knightsville.</p>'
