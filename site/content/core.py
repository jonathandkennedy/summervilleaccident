    ("What should I do right after a car accident in Summerville, SC?",
     f"Call 911 and get checked by a doctor even if you feel fine, photograph the vehicles and the scene, get the other driver's insurance information and the officer's name and report number, and do not give a recorded statement to any insurance company before you talk to a lawyer. Our page on {A(CAR + '/what-to-do-after-a-car-accident-in-south-carolina', 'the first 48 hours after a crash')} walks through each step."),
    ("How long do I have to file an injury claim in South Carolina?",
     f"Three years from the date of the injury for most claims ({cite('sol_injury')}).

See {A(CAR + '/south-carolina-car-accident-statute-of-limitations', 'the statute of limitations')}."),

    ("Is South Carolina an at-fault state?",

She leads every injury case at Frost Law Group: car, truck and motorcycle collisions, pedestrian and rideshare crashes, dog bites, premises injuries, workers\' compensation claims and wrongful death.</p>'
    '<p>Tara believes that effective representation starts with listening. Her personal motto, “Don\'t mistake my kindness for weakness,” describes how she approaches every case. She treats clients with compassion, respect and honesty, and she stands firm when an insurance company or opposing party refuses to do what is right. After a serious accident, clients are often overwhelmed, in pain and unsure what to do next; her job is to make the process clear and manageable while fighting for the compensation and accountability they deserve.</p>'
    '<h2>Judicial service</h2>'
    '<p>Tara served as a Dorchester County Magistrate Judge from July 2022 through August 2025, and then as a Dorchester County Associate Probate Judge from August 2025 through June 2026. Magistrate court is where South Carolina\'s smaller civil claims are tried, and where evidence, credibility and preparation decide cases every week. That experience gives her an unusual perspective on how an injury claim is evaluated, what a fact-finder needs to see, and why the details in a medical record or a collision report matter so much.</p>'
    '<p>Tara no longer serves on the bench and does not appear in matters she handled as a judge.</p>'
    '<h2>Before the law</h2>'
    '<p>Before becoming an attorney, Tara spent roughly sixteen years in the hospitality industry and later owned a window-covering company with her father.

    '<p>Jack Frost was born in Virginia and moved to Summerville with his family at the age of eight. He graduated from Summerville High School and studied political science at the College of Charleston. Following in his grandfather\'s footsteps, he began a career in law enforcement with the Summerville Police Department and went on to serve as a deputy, master deputy and detective with the Charleston County Sheriff\'s Office, retiring after fourteen years.</p>'
    '<p>As a patrol officer and corporal in Summerville he worked the collisions on Main Street, Bacons Bridge Road, Dorchester Road and Highway 17-A: securing scenes, interviewing drivers and witnesses, measuring skid marks and writing the reports that insurers later rely on. As a detective he ran complex investigations, prepared and served search and arrest warrants, conducted surveillance and testified in the courts of Dorchester and Charleston counties. He was also an entry-team member of the Sheriff\'s Office SWAT team.</p>'
